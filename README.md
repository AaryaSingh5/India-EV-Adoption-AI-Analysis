# 🇮🇳 India’s EV Adoption & ICE-to-EV Transition  
### An AI-Driven State-wise Analysis

This project presents a **data-driven and AI-powered framework** to analyze and forecast India's transition from Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) vehicles to Electric Vehicles (EVs) at a **state-wise level**.

The goal is to support **policymakers, investors, and industry stakeholders** with actionable insights into where EV adoption is accelerating and why.

## 🚗 Problem Statement

India’s transition from ICE to EV is highly uneven across states and vehicle segments.  
While policy support and charging infrastructure are key drivers, stakeholders lack tools to:

• Predict *where* EV adoption will grow fastest  
• Understand *why* some states lead while others lag  
• Plan infrastructure and investments accordingly  

---

## 🎯 Objective

Develop an **AI-driven analytical framework** to forecast EV adoption for the next **2–3 years**, providing:

✔ State-wise EV growth predictions  
✔ Feature-driven insights (policy, infra, socio-economic factors)  
✔ Data-backed support for decision making

## 🧠 Methodology

1. **EDA & Feature Engineering**
   - Cleaned raw state-wise EV & ICE data
   - Engineered policy, infrastructure, and growth indicators

2. **Modeling**
   - Trained ML model on historical EV adoption patterns
   - Forecasted adoption for upcoming years

3. **Insights**
   - Identified high-growth states & slow-transition regions
